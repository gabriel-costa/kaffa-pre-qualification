# kaffa-pre-qualification instructions
- All the exercises that include code are in kotlin.
- For exercises 1,2,3,4,5 just run the main class of each one with the kotlin plugin in **Intellij**. 
- In exercise 6, you'll have to import the external library identified in the top of the class and  located in the external-libs directory.
- I did exercise 7 with **Apache Tomcat**, so you'll need a tomcat to configure **Smart Tomcat** as illustrated here(src/main/resources/tomcatConfigs.png).
- Exercise 8 is a .sql file that creates a **PostgreSQL** database that could be used  by an application(the order manager).
